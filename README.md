## About me

Top MSc Economics for Business Intelligence and Systems graduate from the University of Bath, adept in quantitative methods and economic theory. Experienced in real-world applications through research on Government Renewable Energy Procurement Auction design, creating housing market indicators with Fathom Consulting and evaluating development finance expenditure at Development Initiatives. I aim to apply this expertise in crafting and executing strategies for informed decisions and impactful results.

My GitHub focuses on Housing market indicators, models and GIS visualisations

## Example Projects

1. Creating House Price Models in Python
   - Gao and Wangâ€™s (2007) Unbalanced Panel (UP) and an Autoregressive Mixed-Effects (ARME) model, an improved model adapted from Nagaraja et.al (2011), estimate house price indices for 9270 UK postcode sectors from 1996 to 2023 using the HM Land Registry Price Paid dataset.
   - ARME model reduced prediction errer (RMSE) by 21% relative to the UP model.

2. UK sector house price indices Animated Choropleth Map
   - Animated GIS visualisation shows evolution of relative house prices at the UK postcode sector level from 2008 to 2023

3. Housing Market Forecasting Indicator: The Auction Discount Index
   - Novel housing market indicator using auction property sale data to forecast future housing market movements
   - Granger-causality testing concludes ADI capable of aiding in forecasting for up to seven months ahead.

4. Automated Valuation Model
   - Using either the parameters estimted via the UP or ARME models, the AVM codes in Python can instantly value any UK property at any time post 1996.
   - The property must be at least featured once in the Land Registry Price Paid dataset.

5. New York Flights 2013
   - Investigated causes of New York flight delays with SARIMA models and ggplot2 visualisations in R.

6. WW2 Enigma Machine Python Emulator

7. Sudoku Solver
   - Python Sudoku solver using constraint propagation with a MRV heuristic depth first search
