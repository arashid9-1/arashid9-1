## About me

My GitHub focuses on leveraging advanced statistical and data science methods to construct new economic indicators, developing complex yet parsimonious models, novel forecasting tools and creating GIS visualisations.

## Projects

### 1. Oil Price Sensitivity and Dutch Disease Assessment in Saudi Arabia
- Investigated the sensitivity of Saudi Arabia's GDP to oil price shocks and assessed the presence of Dutch Disease using Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) models.
- Simulated 15% and 30% reductions in oil prices between 2022 and 2024 to evaluate their impact on real GDP.
- Explored the relationship between oil prices, the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), and non-oil GDP.

### 2. Quality of Life Index - England 
- Developed a Quality of Life Index (QOLI) for English councils using Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) on eight socioeconomic indicators
- Online interactive choropleth map link: https://quality-of-life-index-england.netlify.app/

### 3. House Price Modelling in Python
   - Implemented Gao and Wangâ€™s (2007) Unbalanced Panel (UP) model and an enhanced Autoregressive Mixed-Effects (ARME) model, based on Nagaraja et al. (2011), to estimate house price indices across 9,270 UK postcode sectors from 1996 to 2023, using HM Land Registry data.
   - Achieved a 21% reduction in prediction error (RMSE) with the ARME model compared to the UP model, demonstrating improved accuracy and reduced estimator bias.

### 4. Animated Choropleth Map of UK House Price Indices
   - Developed an animated GIS visualisation displaying the evolution of relative house prices by UK postcode sector from 2008 to 2023, highlighting the dynamic housing market landscape.

### 5. Housing Market Forecasting Indicator: The Auction Discount Index
   - Introduced a novel indicator, the Auction Discount Index (ADI), utilising auction property sale data to forecast future market trends.
   - Proven forecasting capability up to seven months in advance through Granger-causality testing.

### 6. Automated Valuation Model (AVM)
   - Crafted an AVM in Python for instant valuation of any UK property post-1996, based on parameters estimated via UP or ARME models. The model relies on historical data from the Land Registry Price Paid dataset.
.

### 7. New York Flights 2013 SARIMA Analysis
   - Investigated causes of New York flight delays with SARIMA models and ggplot2 visualisations in R.
